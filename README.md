Project: DIMPLE code
Computational pipeline for analyzing mass spectrometry imaginging data along a linear axis. Developmental Imaging Mass Spectrometry Pipeline for Linear Evaluation (DIMPLE) was first employed as described in Sama et al. 2025. This is the version of the code described in that publication. 

cdf files and available Matlab workspaces are provided for the roots that were analyzed in Sama et al. 2025. 
B73 root 1 data can be accessed in B73-root11 and B73-root11-workspace.mat.
B73 root 2 data can be accessed in B73-root2-5 and B73-root2-5-workspace.mat
B73 root 3 data can be accessed in B73-root-3-3 and B73-root2-3-worskpace.mat

Oaxacan Green Root 1 data can be accessed in OG1 and OG1-workspace-2.mat
Oaxacan Green Root 2 data can be accessed in OG5 and OG5-workspace.mat
Oaxacan Green Root 3 data can be accessed in OG2-P11-0
